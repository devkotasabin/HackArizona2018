Mental Health Watch

This project aims to analyze tweets of people to identify signs of depression and mental illness in twitter users. Our goal is to help as many people as we can at times of their depression, and to enable health workers and interested parties to reach out to these people to provide encouragement and professional help.

Our project uses machine learning approach to analyze tweets using user curated lists of words and phrases to detect tweets that show signs of depression. The analysis is augmented using a webapp which provides visualization of different facets of data. Our data is stored in an RDMBS for realtime fast and flexible querying and analysis. 

In the future, we would like to augment our analysis using various data sources such as health survey data, professional feedback. We aim to integrate advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques that utilize more supervised data. Using this, we want to provide a comprehensive platform that analyzes social media posts on various platforms such as facebook, twitter, etc. We would also like to perform time-series analysis of the time of such social media posts to build a more accurate system.
